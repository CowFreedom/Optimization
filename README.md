# Optimization #

**Optimization** is a [UG4 Plugin](https://github.com/UG4) that provides various algorithms
used in mathematical optimization. Some of these algorithms are applicable to optimization problems with
bounded variables. Currently, the Gauss-Newton algorithm is under development. It will be available in both, CPU and GPU versions.
This plugin is under active development.
